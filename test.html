    <div class="row"> Scorbunny loves to run and is filled with energy. A warm-up run can cause the fire energy in Scorbunny to start coursing through its body, allowing it to fight at full power. It has a sac in its chest that contains fire,[1] which it uses to generate heat from the special pads on the soles of its feet and nose, once it is ready to fight. The pads on Scorbunny's feet can get so hot that it is capable of using them to start small fires and burn opponents with a kick. The anime has shown that its heat pads can also thaw others out of ice. By using its powerful legs, Scorbunny can run and jump around its opponents to confuse and disorient them.[1] It is a rare Pokémon that is found more often under the ownership of Trainers. According to the anime, the soles on Scorbunny's feet are believed to bring good luck.</div>
